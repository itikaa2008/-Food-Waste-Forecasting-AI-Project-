# -Food-Waste-Forecasting-AI-Project-
An AI-driven data science project forecasting food waste aligned with SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption). It analyzes waste patterns to enable efficient resource use and reduce food loss, supporting sustainable food management and informed decision-making.

# 📘 **Project Summary: Food Waste Forecasting Using AI**

## 1️⃣ **Problem Statement**  
Food waste is one of the most pressing global issues of our time.
Despite millions suffering from hunger, a significant portion of edible food goes uneaten due to poor planning and lack of forecasting. Institutions such as schools, hotels, and events often prepare more food than needed, leading to unnecessary waste. Our project aims to address this by creating an AI-based system that predicts food waste patterns and provides actionable insights, thereby helping reduce the gap between food preparation and consumption.

## 2️⃣ **Users / Stakeholders**  

### 👥 **Users / Stakeholders**
Our project benefits key users involved in food management and sustainability efforts:

- 🍽️ **Food Service Providers:** Restaurants, canteens, and caterers who want to reduce excess food and save costs.  
- 🏛️ **Government Bodies:** Officials planning policies to reduce food waste and improve food security.  
- 🌐 **NGOs:** Organizations working to minimize hunger by redistributing surplus food.  
- 🏫 **Educational Institutions:** Schools and colleges aiming to lower cafeteria food wastage.  
- 📊 **Researchers:** Data scientists studying food consumption and waste patterns.  
- 📦 **Supply Chain Managers:** Teams handling food distribution and donation logistics.  


---

### 🎯 **Objectives**

- To analyze historical food waste data and identify patterns.  
- To develop accurate AI models that predict food waste quantities in various settings.  
- To provide actionable insights for food service providers to optimize food preparation.  
- To support sustainability efforts by reducing avoidable food wastage.  
- To enable efficient redistribution of surplus food to communities in need.  
- To raise awareness about responsible consumption and production among stakeholders.

## 4️⃣ **Key Features**  

- 📈 **Predictive analytics** to estimate potential food wastage before meals are prepared.  
- 📊 **Visual dashboards** to monitor consumption trends and identify high-waste periods.  
- 🔔 **Automated alerts or suggestions** for food quantity adjustments.  
- 📋 **Custom reporting tools** for administrative review and documentation.

---

## 5️⃣ **AI Techniques Used** 

🤖 The project applies core machine learning methodologies, including: 
- 🔢 **Linear Regression** for numerical prediction of food wastage quantities based on inputs such as number of people served, meal type, and day of the week.  
- 📊 **K-Means Clustering** for identifying patterns in food waste trends and grouping similar consumption profiles.  

---

## 6️⃣ **Data Used**  

- The dataset comprises records of food preparation and waste collected from various sources globally.  
- Key attributes include date, meal type, number of people served, quantity of food prepared, and amount of food wasted.  
- The data is either sourced from publicly available datasets or simulated to reflect real-world scenarios for global food service operations.  


## 7️⃣ **Proposed Solution**  
Using machine learning models, we predict how much food is likely to go to waste on a given day or under specific conditions. This allows organizations to:

- Prepare the right quantity of food
- Minimize operational and food costs
- Reduce ecological impact
- Donate surplus food in time
---

## 8️⃣ **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Involved**  

- **SDG 2 – Zero Hunger**: By reducing wastage and potentially redirecting surplus food, the project contributes to food security.  
- **SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption and Production**: The project promotes efficient resource usage and aims to reduce the environmental footprint of food services.

---

## 9️⃣ **Future Scope**  
🔮 Potential enhancements and expansions of the project include:  
- 📱 Development of a mobile application interface for real-time forecasting and alerts.  
- 🛰️ Integration with IoT devices such as smart weighing scales or sensors in storage units.  
- 🔄 Automated donation management systems linked with NGOs.  
- 🏢 Institutional adoption at scale for government-run canteens or mid-day meal programs.  
- 📡 Incorporation of real-time data streams for more dynamic and adaptive forecasting.
