# -Food-Waste-Forecasting-AI-Project-
An AI-driven data science project forecasting food waste aligned with SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption). It analyzes waste patterns to enable efficient resource use and reduce food loss, supporting sustainable food management and informed decision-making.

📘 Project Summary: Food Waste Forecasting Using AI

1️⃣ Problem Statement
⚠️ Food wastage in institutional settings such as hostels, school and college canteens, and event catering remains a critical issue. Due to inaccurate estimation of food demand, a significant amount of edible food is discarded daily. This not only leads to financial loss but also contributes to environmental degradation and resource mismanagement. The lack of data-driven systems for predicting food requirements further exacerbates the problem.

2️⃣ Users / Stakeholders

👨‍🍳 Mess and canteen administrators – to optimize food preparation and reduce wastage.
🏫 School/college authorities – to ensure efficient budgeting and sustainable practices.
🎉 Event organizers – to accurately plan catering quantities for different audience sizes.
🏢 Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) – to coordinate food donation and redistribution efforts.
🏛️ Policy-makers and civic bodies – to promote responsible consumption in public food services.

3️⃣ Objectives

Minimize over-preparation of meals.
Promote responsible consumption and sustainability.
Enable better planning and resource allocation.
Support data-driven decision-making in food-related operations.

4️⃣ Key Features

📈 Predictive analytics to estimate potential food wastage before meals are prepared.
📊 Visual dashboards to monitor consumption trends and identify high-waste periods.
🔔 Automated alerts or suggestions for food quantity adjustments.
📋 Custom reporting tools for administrative review and documentation.

5️⃣ AI Techniques Used

🔢 Linear Regression for numerical prediction of food wastage quantities based on inputs such as number of people served, meal type, and day of the week.
📊 K-Means Clustering (optional enhancement) for identifying patterns in food waste trends and grouping similar consumption profiles.
These methods help uncover hidden insights in the data and enhance the precision of future forecasts.

6️⃣ Data Used


7️⃣ Proposed Solution
✅ The solution involves collecting historical food consumption and waste data, training a machine learning model, and using the model to predict future food requirements. By integrating this system with simple dashboards or admin tools, decision-makers can take proactive steps to reduce waste.

8️⃣ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Involved

SDG 2 – Zero Hunger: By reducing wastage and potentially redirecting surplus food, the project contributes to food security.
SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption and Production: The project promotes efficient resource usage and aims to reduce the environmental footprint of food services.

9️⃣ Future Scope

📱 Development of a mobile application interface for real-time forecasting and alerts.
🛰️ Integration with IoT devices such as smart weighing scales or sensors in storage units.
🔄 Automated donation management systems linked with NGOs.
🏢 Institutional adoption at scale for government-run canteens or mid-day meal programs.
📡 Incorporation of real-time data streams for more dynamic and adaptive forecasting.
