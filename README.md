# -Food-Waste-Forecasting-AI-Project-
An AI-driven data science project forecasting food waste aligned with SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption). It analyzes waste patterns to enable efficient resource use and reduce food loss, supporting sustainable food management and informed decision-making.

# 📘 **Project Summary: Food Waste Forecasting Using AI**

## 1️⃣ **Problem Statement**  
⚠️ Food wastage in institutional settings such as hostels, school and college canteens, and event catering remains a critical issue. Due to inaccurate estimation of food demand, a significant amount of edible food is discarded daily. This not only leads to financial loss but also contributes to environmental degradation and resource mismanagement. The lack of data-driven systems for predicting food requirements further exacerbates the problem.

## 2️⃣ **Users / Stakeholders**  

- 👨‍🍳 **Mess and canteen administrators** – to optimize food preparation and reduce wastage.  
- 🏫 **School/college authorities** – to ensure efficient budgeting and sustainable practices.  
- 🎉 **Event organizers** – to accurately plan catering quantities for different audience sizes.  
- 🏢 **Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)** – to coordinate food donation and redistribution efforts.  
- 🏛️ **Policy-makers and civic bodies** – to promote responsible consumption in public food services.

---

## 3️⃣ **Objectives**  

- Minimize over-preparation of meals.  
- Promote responsible consumption and sustainability.  
- Enable better planning and resource allocation.  
- Support data-driven decision-making in food-related operations.

---

## 4️⃣ **Key Features**  

- 📈 **Predictive analytics** to estimate potential food wastage before meals are prepared.  
- 📊 **Visual dashboards** to monitor consumption trends and identify high-waste periods.  
- 🔔 **Automated alerts or suggestions** for food quantity adjustments.  
- 📋 **Custom reporting tools** for administrative review and documentation.

---

## 5️⃣ **AI Techniques Used**  
🤖 The project applies core machine learning methodologies, including:  
- 🔢 **Linear Regression** for numerical prediction of food wastage quantities based on inputs such as number of people served, meal type, and day of the week.  
- 📊 **K-Means Clustering (optional enhancement)** for identifying patterns in food waste trends and grouping similar consumption profiles.  

---

## 6️⃣ **Data Used**  
📂 The dataset includes relevant parameters such as:  
- Number of people served per meal  
- Type and timing of meals (breakfast/lunch/dinner)  
- Quantity of food prepared  
- Quantity of food wasted  
- Date and day of the week  
- Event indicators (if applicable)  
The data can be sourced from custom institutional records or available datasets on platforms such as Kaggle.

---

## 7️⃣ **Proposed Solution**  
✅ The solution involves collecting historical food consumption and waste data, training a machine learning model, and using the model to predict future food requirements. By integrating this system with simple dashboards or admin tools, decision-makers can take proactive steps to reduce waste.

---

## 8️⃣ **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Involved**  
🌐 This project directly supports the following United Nations Sustainable Development Goals:  
- **SDG 2 – Zero Hunger**: By reducing wastage and potentially redirecting surplus food, the project contributes to food security.  
- **SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption and Production**: The project promotes efficient resource usage and aims to reduce the environmental footprint of food services.

---

## 9️⃣ **Future Scope**  
🔮 Potential enhancements and expansions of the project include:  
- 📱 Development of a mobile application interface for real-time forecasting and alerts.  
- 🛰️ Integration with IoT devices such as smart weighing scales or sensors in storage units.  
- 🔄 Automated donation management systems linked with NGOs.  
- 🏢 Institutional adoption at scale for government-run canteens or mid-day meal programs.  
- 📡 Incorporation of real-time data streams for more dynamic and adaptive forecasting.
